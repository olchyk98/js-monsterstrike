My simple retro game on javascript.

*One day engineers have opened the portal in a parallel world. When they discovered it,
many disasters have occurred. It turned out that monsters from the parallel world do not develop in the vector of science.
They developed their strength and speed.
They were ready to invade other creatures. And now their time has come.
The people who survived are fighting with them. One of them - our hero, one of the engineers who opened the portal.
Realizing the situation and using the medicine that he found the lab, he got some good skills.*

**PSss. In the game there are items that appear randomly to help you.**

It's commonplace, but I like it :)
